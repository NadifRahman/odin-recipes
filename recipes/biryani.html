    <h2>How to cook Biryani?</h2>
    <p> Biryani is a celebrated Indian dish that boasts layers of spiced rice, tender marinated meat, and a medley of aromatic herbs and spices. 
        It's often garnished with fried onions, nuts, and coriander, and infused with saffron for its characteristic color and richness. The key 
        to an authentic biryani lies in the careful balance of flavors and the technique of cooking it under a low flame, which allows the ingredients 
        to meld together in a symphony of taste and aroma. Each region in India has its own version of biryani, making it a versatile and universally 
        loved dish.</p>
