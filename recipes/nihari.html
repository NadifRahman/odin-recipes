    <h2>What is Nihari?</h2>
    <p> Nihari is a slow-cooked stew originating from the Indian subcontinent, popularly eaten in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. It's known for its savory 
        richness and depth of flavor. The dish is traditionally made with beef or lamb and sometimes goat, slowly simmered overnight or for many hours, which 
        results in meat that is exceptionally tender. The sauce is typically redolent with a host of warm, aromatic spices like garam masala, cardamom, 
        cinnamon, cloves, and bay leaves, often thickened with flour or ground wheat to create a velvety texture. Nihari is frequently garnished with fresh 
        cilantro, ginger slices, and green chilies and is typically served with naan bread or rice, making it a hearty and comforting dish. It is especially 
        favored during the colder months and is often enjoyed as a festive meal or for special occasions.</p>

        <li>Ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>Onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Ghee or cooking oil</li>
        <li>Nihari spice mix (which includes a blend of garam masala, fennel powder, cumin, and coriander)</li>
        <li>Red chili powder</li>
        <li>Turmeric powder</li>
        <li>Bay leaves</li>
        <li>Green cardamoms</li>
        <li>Cloves</li>

        <li>Cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>Star anise</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh ginger and fresh cilantro for garnish</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat ghee or oil in a large pot and fry the onions until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the meat to the pot and brown it well on all sides.</li>
        <li>Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and fry for a couple of minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
        <li>Add the Nihari spice mix, red chili powder, and turmeric, and cook the spices until they release their aroma.</li>
        <li>Pour in enough water to cover the meat and bring it to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to the lowest setting, cover the pot, and let the meat simmer for several hours until tender.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix wheat flour with water to make a smooth paste and gradually add it to the stew to thicken the gravy.</li>
        <li>Continue to simmer the stew after adding the flour paste, making sure to stir regularly to prevent lumps from forming.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is tender and the gravy has thickened to your liking, adjust salt to taste and remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh coriander, ginger, and green chilies. Serve hot with naan bread or rice and lemon wedges on the side.</li>
