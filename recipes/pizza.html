    <h2>What is Pizza?</h2>
    <p> Pizza is a beloved Italian dish that has gained immense popularity across the globe. It consists of a round, flat base of dough, which is topped with 
        a tomato sauce, cheese, and a variety of other ingredients such as meats, vegetables, and herbs. The dough is then baked to perfection, resulting in a 
        deliciously crispy and flavorful crust. Originating from Naples, Italy, pizza has evolved into numerous styles and variations, from the thin and crispy
        Neapolitan pizza to the thick and hearty Chicago-style deep-dish. Its versatility and universal appeal have made pizza a staple in many cultures, 
        celebrated for its simplicity and the endless possibilities of toppings.</p>
